    # Jamal Murray, Fred VanVleet and James Harden have made.

    # 1.2 Print out the number of three point shots using 
    # f-strings with the variables you created for each player

    # In the 2020 NBA playoffs, Jamal Murray, Fred VanVleet, and James Harden attempted
    # 93, 110, 109 three point shots total.
    
    # 1.3 Create variables to store the values above

    # Build on your print statement!
    
    # 1.4 Copy the print statements you wrote above in 1.2 and extend them by:
    # Printing both the number of three point shots each player made AND 
    # the number of three point shots each player attempted. 
    # Use only one print() statement for each player 
    # (remember that you can use 'f-strings' to insert variables into lines of text 
    # (reference the examples above if you forgot how to do this).

    # 1.5 Calculate and print the three point percentage for each player
    # (The three point percentage is given by the following formula: 
    # 3 point shots made/3 point shots attempted)

    # Below is a big paragraph of text about the Lakers 2020 season from
    # https://www.lineups.com/nba/roster/los-angeles-lakers

    # The Lakers went all in this offseason and swung a deal for former Pelicans forward Anthony Davis. They sent a package of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans to land Davis. Those three have made good developments with the Pelicans, especially Brandon Ingram. But, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron, Davis, and company have put together an incredible season. Los Angeles has ridden James and Davis, along with a supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA. The Lakers ended the season atop the Western Conference with a record of 49-14. They were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league. Davis proved to the final piece necessary for the Lakers to rebound from missing the playoff√≠s last year. Los Angeles was a dominant club on both sides of the ball and are in a position to have another successful year next season.

    # 2.1 Can you add escape characters to print out this text from a python script to the command line
    # so that only one sentence is on each line?

    # Are the Lakers the best team?

    # 2.2 Make a boolean variable called lakers_are_best that indicates, to the best of your knowledge, 
    # whether the following statement is true: The Lakers are the best basketball team in the NBA

    # 2.3 Using an f-string containing your lakers_are_best variable, print out your evaluation of 
    # whether the statement was true or not

    # 2.4 Convert your lakers_are_best variable to an integer, and print it out. 
    # Why do you think it takes this value?

    # 2.5 Convert your lakers_are best variable to a float, and print it out

    # 2.6 Take each player's three point percentage from above, convert it to a string, then print it out.
    # What do you notice?

    # 2.7 Take each player's three point percentage (from part 2.5) and convert it to an integer, 
    # then print it out.
    # What do you notice?
