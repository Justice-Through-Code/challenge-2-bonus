    # In the 2020 NBA playoffs, Jamal Murray, Fred VanVleet, and James Harden rank
    # #1, #2, and #3 respectively for the number of 3-point shots made at 46, 43, and 37.

    # 1.1 Create variables to track the number of 3-point shots that
    # Jamal Murray, Fred VanVleet and James Harden have made.

    # 1.2 Print out the number of three point shots per person using 
    # f-strings with the variables created above for each player, for the result:
    # 'Person A: x, Person B: y, Person C: z'

    # In the 2020 NBA playoffs, Jamal Murray, Fred VanVleet, and James Harden attempted
    # 93, 110, 109 three point shots total.
    
    # 1.3 Create variables to store the values above

    # 1.4 Calculate and print the three point percentage for each player, rounded to 2 decimal points.
    # The three point percentage is given by the following formula: 
    # 3-point shots made/3-point shots attempted
    # Can you turn that into a percentage? Ala:
    # "Player A's three point percentage is d%. Player B's three point percentage is e%. Player C's three point percentage is f%."


def process_laker_data():
    # Are the Lakers the best team?

    # 2.1 Make a boolean variable called are_lakers_best that indicates, to the best of your knowledge, 
    # whether the following statement is true: The Lakers are the best basketball team in the NBA

    # 2.2 Using an f-string containing your are_lakers_best variable, print out your evaluation of 
    # whether the statement was true or not

    # 2.3 Convert your are_lakers_best variable to an integer, and print it out. 
    # Why do you think it takes this value?

    # 2.4 Convert your are_lakers_best variable to a float, and print it out

    # 2.5 Take each player's three point percentage from above, convert it to a string, then print it out.
    # What do you notice?

    # 2.6 Take each player's three point percentage (from part 2.5) and convert it to an integer, 
    # then print it out.
    # What do you notice?
